# Original Project Plan

## Methodology:

**Make list of cars in F&F**
  - How to determine cars? ALL or Only ones main characters interact with AKA Significant?

**Get basic car data:**
- Year
- Make
- Model
- Trim
- Do we want to include mods or just stock?
- Which movie they appeared in.
- Character driving?
- Price
  - Determine which prices to include?
  - Base price when it came out
  - Current market value
  - Price including mods or stock?
  - Price of mods?
  - Adjust for inflation?
  - Historical market price(need to find this data)


**Get movie(s) release dates**
**Plot out cars’ historical prices, is there a bump after the movies? Other bumps?(i.e. PW death)**

Any other factors that may influence price (scarcity, country released (i.e. skyline not  street legal in US, only as classic car when its 20 years old), other…?)
Maybe other movies cars appeared in…?

Determine other analysis & visualizations that can be done on the data

## Challenges Faced

Unable to find a reliable source for historical car sales data past 5 years.
This limited the analysis I was able to do and I could not draw any conclusions regarding if the movies affected the price of the cars.
